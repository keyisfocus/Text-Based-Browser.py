# Text-Based Browser https://hyperskill.org/projects/79

## Stage 1
1. You should write a program that takes a string from the user (URL) and outputs a "hard-coded" website with news (just a header and some text below).
The websites are presented as two variables in source code; you can see them in the template. These are mock versions of the sites bloomberg.com and nytimes.com. You just need to output them as a response to the corresponding input URL.
2. Also, you should add the option to quit the browser by typing `exit`. Real browsers donâ€™t finish their work when they output a single web page, they are ready to accept a new URL at any moment. You should implement this behavior, too. An endless loop can help you with that part.
